# Selection Criteria for Educational Resources included in the Data Management Training Clearinghouse \(DMTC\)
#### Revised 3 November 2021


### **Definition:** _*"Educational resources"*are downloadable or interactive digital assets that can be used as teaching, learning, and assessing resources as well as those used for educational research purposes._
\(Adapted from [Open Educational Resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources )\)

#### **Scope of topics:**

Within the broader term “educational resources”, the inventory of resources included in the DMTC are primarily comprised of teaching and learning resources given our target audiences of research data “teachers” and “learners.”   Topics to be included in the DMTC are limited to those on research and data lifecycles including research data management; building skills, competencies and capabilities related to research data; research data sharing and reuse where appropriate; and best practices for creating and managing high quality research data.  The primary subject domains for the educational topics are those in science, technical, engineering, and medicine \(STEM\), social science, education and training, and arts and humanities.  Other research topics may be included if the primary focus of the educational resources is upon teaching research data skills. 

#### **Specific criteria to be considered beyond topic:**  **1\) Learning resource type; 2\) Format \(media type\); 3\) Target audiences; 4\) Subject discipline covered; 5\) Uniqueness of topic coverage or method of instruction.**

**1\.  Learning resource type:** \(category for what kind of learning resource is being described\)

**Most used:**

  *  __Course__ \(series of units and lessons used to teach the skills and knowledge; often associated with a broader curriculum\)
  
  *  __Unit__ \(long-range plan of instruction on a particular concept containing multiple, related lessons\)
  *  __Lesson__ \(detailed description of an element of instruction in a course that could be contained in a unit of one or more lessons; has been used for presentation slides on a topic\)
  *  __Demonstration / Simulation__ \(imitation or modeling of a real-world process; has been used for tutorials on tools used or processing done within the research data lifecycle\)
  
  *  __Learning Activity__ \(guided or unguided activity engaged in by a learner to acquire skills, concepts or knowledge that may or may not be defined by a lesson; has been used for data “recipes”, data exercises or other hands-on activities\)
  
  *  __Educator Curriculum Guide__ \(provides definition of what concepts should be taught and /or how a concept should be taught effectively; has been used for course syllabi\)
  
  *  __Images / Visuals__ \(standalone representation of a concept used to instruct visually including, but not limited to, pictures, graphics, diagrams, figures, illustrations, charts, and maps; has been used for posters and one page reference guides|)
  
  **Available, but rarely used:**
  
  *  __Text__ \(body of a printed work, to include reading passages; only used if part of a collection of digital assets.  \[See Format/Media Type below for definition of “collection.”\]  Published papers, downloadable textbooks and static web pages are generally out of scope\)

*  __Textbook__ \(digital book used as a standard source of information on a particular subject, generally out of scope\)

*  __Primary source__  \((artifact, document, recording or other source of information created at the time under study and provides first-hand testimony or direct evidence concerning a topic under investigation\)

*  __Assessment__  \(evaluation, measurement and documentation of the skills or knowledge gained from instruction\); the types of assessment could include:
   *  Alternate assessment -  used to evaluate he performance of students who are unable to participate in general assessment even with accommodations
   *  Assessment item – specific part of an assessment that, when answered by a learner, is used to determine whether a learning object has been achieved
   *  Formative assessment – process used during instruction to adjust ongoing teaching and learning activities and to improve students’ achievements of intended instructional outcomes 
   *  Interim / Summative assessment – instrument used to evaluate student learning at the end of an instructional unit by comparing it against come standard or benchmark
   *  Self-assessment – in which a user gathers information about and reflects on their own knowledge, skills, learning or attitudes
