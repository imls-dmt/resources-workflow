# Workflow for Tracking Processing of **Data Management Training Clearinghouse** resources

Create a new [issue](https://github.com/imls-dmt/resources-workflow/issues) by:

a. Clicking on the *New Issue* button

b. Filling in the information for the provided issue form

c. Assign it to the *New Resources Workflow* project on the right side of the screen

Once the issue has been created and added to the *New Resources Workflow* project it will appear as
a card in the [project tracking screen](https://github.com/imls-dmt/resources-workflow/projects/1) 
where it can then be moved into the different phases of the resource development, review, revision, 
approval, and publication process. 

The states of the resources are:

1. **Registered** - an initial item record has been created in the clearinghouse, resulting in a
corresponding node link that is included in the issue created in the workflow. 

2. **Under Active Development** - the resource is under active development - i.e. metadata is being
collected and entered into the system based upon the initial registration created when the item was
discovered. Once metadata entry has been completed **move the item "card" from the *Uncer Active Development*
column into the *Under Review* column. 

3. **Under Review** - the resource has been submitted for review by the relevant editor for one of two
actions: 

	 a. **If no further modifications are needed**, move the card from the *Under Review* column into the *Approved* column

	 b. **If modificaitons are needed prior to approval**, move the card from the *Under Review* column into the *Under Active Development* column and assign the "revise - resubmit" label to the issue to differentiate it from the initial submission

	 c. **If the item should not be published through the clearinghouse**, move the card from *Under Review* column into the *Reviewed - Do Not Publish* column. Add notes to the issue explaining why the resource should not be published. 

4. **Approved** - the resource has been reviewed and has been determined ready for publication. When the item is published move it from the "Approved" column into the "Published" column.  

5. **Published** - the resource has been published in the clearinghouse.

6. **Reviewed - Do Not Publish** - the item has been reviewed and found not to be publishable in the clearinghouse. The notes for the issue associated with the resource should describe the reason for not being published. 

**NOTE:** Comments can be added to the issue related to the resource at any point in the process to
capture information about the process: e.g.

* Notes about the metadata as it is being captured
* Review notes that document the review process and any changes/updates that will be needed prior to approval
* Any other notes that would prove useful in future reviews
